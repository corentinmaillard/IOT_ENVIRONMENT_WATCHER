# About the project
The purpose of the project is to reduce the consumption of water while watering the plants of a fields during drought. For that we will use 3 types of sensors :
- Soil moisture sensor : to check if we really need to water the field
- Light sensor : to check if the light is too bright and risk of burning the plant if they are watered
- Humidity and temperature sensor : to check the temperature
